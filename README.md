RESTful-Connector
=================

Helping you connect to third-party RESTful APIs using HTTP and OAuth 2.0

## Setup
* Rename 'example.keys.php' to 'keys.php' and add your apps' secrets and client IDs.

  If you're using this code as part of an open source project, do one of the following:
  * Save keys.php in a different folder and update either `require_once('keys.php')` or your PHP include_path
  * Add `keys.php` to your .gitignore

    I cannot be held responsible if you allow your app's secret to become public

## Supported APIs
* [ ] Facebook (in development)
* [ ] Twitter
* [ ] Google+

* [ ] Foursquare
* [ ] Easy-to-set Icon Sets
